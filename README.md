# odin-recipes
In this project, I tried to practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired before.Aim was to build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 
Project was just to build my HTML chops; I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
